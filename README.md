Time series exploratory data analysis and clustering
Introduction - What is this about?

Time series forms one of the aspects of looking at the past and predicting future. It reflects the resultant of numerous (or few) factors affecting over time to influence certain behaviour. Time series analysis is usually undertaken when one cannot articulate all the underlying variables affecting outcome. Examples of time series are - sales over past few years, stock price over a day or month or year. There are many variables and not all can be articulated.

And why would past reflect future? Good question. On a going basis, the assumption is that the outcome at a particular instance in past was sum total of numerous variables and going forward in a similar instance of time, the influence would be corelated. e.g. sales showing seasonality at a week/month/yearly levels.

In a typical business processes, time series analysis and forecasting will be part of periodic planning cycle and would be a good starting point for superimposing business strategies in future time periods. In an organizational context, there would be significant number of products or SKUs (Stock keeping Units) that would be planned across various distribution centres.

So where does clustering fit in? Clustering in theoretical sense is a grouping of entities which display similar behavioural characteristics. It can be of oneâ€™s interest to find out which entities exhibiting common characteristics to articulate strategies to a specific cluster to gain control over them.

## Objective

This dataset is of a small financial institution with transactions of cash deposit and withdrawals over a period of time. These are at the day level. There is a geographical spread of various branches. Each branch will have its own characteristics of deposits and withdrawals based on the type of catchment area it caters to.

Objective here would be to cluster various branches based on behaviour of deposits and withdrawals. Overarching objective (beyond scope of this exercise) which such study would be to use this cluster information to develop forecasting model with its parameters tuned to a certain cluster.

Repository contains the code to evaluate same. Since the data is under propriety, it is not uploaded.
